# DroneAC
This was a project myself and 2 other colleagues have built to present at a faculty presentation for middle school and high school students. There were multiple projects presented there. Our team played around with the Parrot Python SDK to show off some tricks programatically using a parrot done such as:
* Getting from point A to point B by using a predefined path
* Making flips
* Controlling the parrot using the keyboard arrows
